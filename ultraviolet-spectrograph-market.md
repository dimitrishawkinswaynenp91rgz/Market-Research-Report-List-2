<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet Spectrograph Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Beam</li><li>Double-Beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultraviolet spectrographs are available in two main market types: Single-Beam and Double-Beam. Single-Beam spectrographs operate by measuring the intensity of light before and after it interacts with a sample, which is then compared to analyze the sample's properties. On the other hand, Double-Beam spectrographs split the light beam into two separate paths, one passing through the sample and the other serving as a reference. This enables more accurate and reliable measurements in applications requiring high precision and sensitivity.</p></p>
