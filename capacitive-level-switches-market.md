<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Level Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dielectric Type (D-Type)</li><li>Conductive Type (L-Type)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Capacitive level switches are classified into two main types - dielectric type (D-Type) and conductive type (L-Type). Dielectric type switches use the change in dielectric constant between the sensor and the medium to detect the presence of liquid, while conductive type switches rely on the conductivity of the medium to trigger the switch. Dielectric type switches are commonly used for non-metallic liquids, while conductive type switches are suitable for conductive liquids such as water.</p></p>
