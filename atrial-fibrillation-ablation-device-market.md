<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Devices market consists of two main types: Catheter Ablation and Maze Surgery. Catheter Ablation involves using a catheter to target and destroy specific areas in the heart that are causing irregular heartbeats. Maze Surgery, on the other hand, is a more invasive procedure that involves creating a series of scar lines on the heart to redirect abnormal electrical signals. Both procedures aim to restore normal heart rhythm and improve the overall quality of life for patients with atrial fibrillation.</p></p>
