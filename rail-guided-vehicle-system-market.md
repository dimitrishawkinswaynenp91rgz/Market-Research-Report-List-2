<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rail Guided Vehicle System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic</li><li>All-automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rail Guided Vehicle Systems can be categorized into two main types: semi-automatic and all-automatic. In semi-automatic systems, operators manually control the vehicles to move along the designated rail paths, while the vehicle itself may handle tasks such as loading and unloading. On the other hand, all-automatic systems involve fully automated vehicles that navigate along rail tracks without the need for human intervention. These systems are equipped with sensors and software to make decisions and perform tasks autonomously, increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of errors.</p></p>
