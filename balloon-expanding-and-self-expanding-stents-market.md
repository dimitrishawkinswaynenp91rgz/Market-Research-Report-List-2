<p><h1>Balloon Expanding and Self Expanding Stents Market Growth, Market Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts for period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Balloon Expanding and Self Expanding Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Balloon expanding and self-expanding stents are devices used in interventional cardiology to treat coronary artery disease by restoring blood flow in narrowed or blocked arteries. Balloon-expanding stents are deployed using an inflatable balloon, while self-expanding stents expand on their own due to their elastic properties.</p><p>The global market for balloon-expanding and self-expanding stents is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.00% during the forecast period. The key drivers for market growth include the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, advancements in stent technology, and the growing demand for minimally invasive procedures. Additionally, the rising aging population and improving healthcare infrastructure in emerging economies contribute to the market growth.</p><p>In terms of trends, the market is witnessing a shift towards bioresorbable stents, which dissolve in the body over time, eliminating the need for a permanent implant. The development of drug-eluting stents with improved drug delivery mechanisms and reduced risk of restenosis is also a significant trend in the market. Furthermore, increasing research and development activities aimed at enhancing stent performance and reducing complications are expected to drive innovation and growth in the balloon-expanding and self-expanding stents market.</p></p>
